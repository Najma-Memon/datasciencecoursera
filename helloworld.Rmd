## R Markdown

```{r}
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

```

```{r}

```

\`\`\`{summary(cars)} summary (This is a markdown file)

## plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

plot(pressure) \`\`\`

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
